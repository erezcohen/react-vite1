steps:

- name: analyze_figma_design
  description: Extract and analyze the selected Figma design
  prompt: |
  You need to convert a Figma design to a React component. Start by analyzing the selected design:
  1. First, get the selected Figma object and its properties
  2. Capture a high-quality image of the design
  3. Analyze the design elements including:
     - Layout structure and hierarchy
     - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
     - Color palette and theming
     - Spacing and dimensions
     - Interactive elements and states
     - Responsive behavior hints
     - Accessibility considerations

  Provide a detailed breakdown of what you're working with.

- name: research_best_practices
  description: Get latest React and UI development best practices
  prompt: |
  Now you need to research the latest best practices for React UI development. Gather
  information about:
  1. Current React patterns and hooks best practices (2024-2025)
  2. Tailwind v4
  3. Accessibility implementation patterns
  4. Component composition and prop patterns
  5. TypeScript interface design for UI components
  6. Testing strategies for UI components

  Focus on approaches that would be most suitable for the design you're implementing.

- name: plan_component_architecture
  description: Design the component structure and implementation plan
  prompt: |
  Based on the Figma design analysis and best practices research, create a detailed
  implementation plan:
  1. Component breakdown (atomic design approach)
     - Identify reusable atoms, molecules, and organisms
     - Define component hierarchy and composition

  2. Props interface design
     - Required and optional props
     - Event handlers and callbacks
     - Styling customization options

  3. State management approach
     - Local state requirements
     - Context needs (if any)
     - External state integration points

  4. Accessibility implementation
     - ARIA attributes needed
     - Keyboard navigation support
     - Screen reader considerations

  5. Responsive design strategy
     - Breakpoints and layout adjustments
     - Mobile-first approach considerations

  Review this plan and suggest any improvements before starting to code.

- name: implement_react_component
  description: Create the React component with TypeScript
  prompt: |
  Now implement the React component based on your analysis and plan:
  1. Create the main component file with:
     - Proper TypeScript interfaces
     - Clean component structure using modern React patterns
     - Responsive styling
     - Accessibility attributes
     - Error boundaries where appropriate

  2. Create any necessary sub-components

  3. Add proper prop validation and default values

  4. Include comprehensive JSDoc comments

  5. Ensure the component follows the established project patterns

  Write clean, maintainable code that matches the Figma design exactly while following React best practices.

- name: browser_validation
  description: Test the component in browser and iterate
  prompt: |
  Time to validate the implementation in the browser:
  1. Find the application in the opened browser
  2. Compare with the original Figma design
  3. Check for:
     - Visual accuracy (spacing, colors, typography)
     - Responsive behavior across different screen sizes
     - Interactive states (hover, focus, active)
     - Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

  4. Take screenshots for comparison with the Figma design
  5. Identify any discrepancies and iterate on the implementation
  6. Test edge cases and different prop combinations

  Continue iterating until the implementation perfectly matches the design and functions flawlessly.

- name: create_unit_tests
  description: Write comprehensive unit tests and update existing ones
  prompt: |
  Now create thorough unit tests for the component using Jest and React Testing Library.

  Please refer to and execute the create-unit-test.md command located in
  `.claude/commands/create-unit-test.md` to create comprehensive unit tests for this component.
  Follow all the patterns and best practices defined in the command.
  If you cannot find this command please abort and let me know.

  When using that command, make sure to focus the tests on the new Pages / Components you just created.

- name: create_e2e_tests
  description: Write Playwright end-to-end tests and update existing ones
  prompt: |
  Finally, create Playwright e2e tests to validate the component in real browser scenarios:

  Please refer to and execute the create-e2e-test.md command located in
  `.claude/commands/create-e2e-test.md` to create comprehensive e2e tests for this component.
  Follow all the patterns and best practices defined in the command.
  If you cannot find this command please abort and let me know.

  When using that command, make sure to focus the tests on the new Pages / Components you just created.

- name: final_validation
  description: Final review and documentation
  prompt: |
  Do a final validation and create proper documentation:
  1. Compare the final implementation with the original Figma design one more time
  2. Run all tests to ensure they pass
  3. Check code quality and consistency
  4. Create or update component documentation including:
     - Usage examples
     - Props API documentation
     - Accessibility notes
     - Browser support information
     - Known limitations or considerations

  5. Add the component to Storybook (if available)
  6. Update any relevant design system documentation

  Provide a summary of what was created, how it matches the original design,
  and any recommendations for future improvements or extensions.

## Design System and Asset Guidelines

### Figma Design Integration

When working with Figma designs, **ALWAYS** copy the actual assets and specifications from Figma rather than creating custom approximations:

- **Icons and SVG Assets**: Download and use the actual SVG assets from Figma using `mcp__figma__get_code` tool
- **Typography**: Use exact font specifications (Inter Bold, Medium, etc.) and sizing from Figma
- **Colors**: Use precise hex color values from the design (`#0d0f1c`, `#565a6f`, etc.)
- **Spacing and Layout**: Match exact padding, margins, and positioning values from Figma export
- **Component Styling**: Replicate exact visual properties (rounded-full for circular buttons, etc.)

**Never assume or approximate** - always verify against the actual Figma design and extract real assets when available. This ensures pixel-perfect implementation and maintains design consistency.

## Checking the UI and design implementation in the browser

Assume that dev server is already running on http://localhost:5173/.
Also, a chrome browser is already running and pointing to that address, with the BrowserTools MCP plugin working in it.
