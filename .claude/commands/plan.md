Create a detailed plan for the research defined in $ARGUMENTS. Think hardest.

Follow the instructions in .claude/commands/figma-to-react.md.

Write a short overview of what you are planning to do.
Identify files that need to be changed and explain shortly what needs to be changed.

Write a list of the unit tests and e2e tests you plan to add and edit.
Include in the list just the name of tests and whether they are new or should be edited.

use context7 to make sure you are picking the most up-to-date documentation and best practices.

Once I approve the plan, write it to a file with the same name under dev/plans/.
Do not implement it yet.
